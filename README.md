# yoked-cli
Yoked Command Line Client

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/undeadops/yoked-cli.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/undeadops/yoked-cli)

Yoked provides ssh public key management for cloud environments.  Its client
polls the yoked server api for a list of approved users and their public ssh keys
and installs those onto itself.  Adjust client polling interval for rapid add/remove
of user accounts and ssh keys.  Only meant to manage end-user access not system
or application accounts, use configuration management for that.  Configuring
sshd to only accept ssh keys highly recommended.

Usage
-----

Client connects to API server to manage SSH keys and user accounts.  Group users
and systems, and associating as needed for defined access.
